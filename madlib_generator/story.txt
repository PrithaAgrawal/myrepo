Today, my best friend and I went to the zoo.
We saw a(n) <adjective> <animal> jumping up and down in its tree. 
He <verb (past tense)> <adverb> through the large tunnel that led to its <adjective> <habitat>.
I was so <emotion> because I’ve never seen anything like it before.
The zookeeper told us that its favorite food is <food>, but I didn’t have any <food> with me.
I gave it a(n) <noun> to eat instead.
Next, we went to the petting zoo where we saw a(n) <adjective> <animal>. 
It looked like it needed <noun>. I had fun <verb ending in -ing> with it. 
We decided to buy some <plural noun> and head to our favorite part of the zoo. 
The highlight of the day was when a <adjective> <animal> <verb (past tense)> right in front of us!
